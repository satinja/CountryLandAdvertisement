The real estate sector is gaining its peak in India. The main driver behind it is the overall economy of India, which is growing rapidly thus attracting foreign investments. The investment in diferrent sector give rise to economy.

The real estate business, since its inception, has centered around its advertisement by buyer to attract as much potential buyers as possible. Then comes the negotiation part, which I will leave to some later point.

To advertize the real estate, small scale and large scale businesses have used different techniques like agent/mediator, 3D ariel view, Video capruting/calling etc. I must say, most of them are really effective techniques in capturing the buyers attention in Urban areas. But, there are area like Agricultural land and sub-urb areas, where the difficulty in selling/purchasing lands become really hectic and involves a dedicated broker.

The broker works as mediator, who fixes buyer seller appointment, helps in negotiating the deal, takes buyers to the actual site and when deal is fianlized the broker charges some fair amount of money to both buyer and seller.

You can clearly see that the buyer-seller-broker ties are to fragile here, and in more than 90 percentage of the case, someone in this link gives up. The main reason behind giving up is the lengthy process.
